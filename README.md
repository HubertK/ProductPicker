ProductPicker
=============

Something I made when I wanted to learn more about animations and gesture recognizers. 

Made for iPad in Landscape mode. 

To use:

  1. Turn on the power button located at the top left of the screen.
  2. Select a product from the selector
  3. Or slide the slector manually (letting go of the selector in between products, will cause it to slide to the nearest product).
  4. Power off with power button
